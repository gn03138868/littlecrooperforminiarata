# little cropper for miniARATA
It is not easy to obtain 200X200 pixels images one by one. So we wrote a simple script for doing it.

Background of image collection

We installed three scanners, each with dimensions of 216 × 296 mm2 (5,100 × 7,020 pixel^2) in Chamaecyparis obtusa (C. obtusa) forest at Kiryu Experimental Watershed (KEW) and Larix kaempferi (K. kaempferi) and Cryptomeria japonica (C. japonica) forests at Shinshu University, totalling 9 individuals.

The experiment commenced in August 2020 in the Kiryu forest, with the scanning of root images occurring every hour (31,904 images from 3 scanners at C. obtusa). 
Following internal discussions, image data (42 images from 3 scanners at L. kaempferi and 33 images from 3 scanners at C. japonica) were collected at Shinshu University at approximately monthly intervals starting in April 2022. 

All data collection finished in November 2022. After collecting the data, the first step involved data clearing, followed by the creation of 16.9 × 16.9 mm^2 (400 × 400 pixel^2) bicolour-labelled images for training the ARATA model.

Further, we used KEW's image to further crop root tips 200 × 200 pixel^2 images by the little cropper for mini ARATA.
